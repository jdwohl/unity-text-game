    textResponse: 'The marks on the string of this bow indicate it was fired recently.
      Under a small sheet next to the bow is a bloody arrow -- the officer here says
      tests were done, and it''s the stadium victim''s blood. What I heard before
      I started investigating was that every victim was pierced through the chest
      by some sharp object -- if this is the case, this arrow must have been fired
      from a bow to kill whichever victim. A stab wound from this arrow would not
      pierce the body so cleanly. '
