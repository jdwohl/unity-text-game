    textResponse: "Buried in the sand are pieces of broken china. The sharpest edge
      is stained red with  blood (the lake victim's, according to the officer) while
      the edges on the outside of the original plate are blue. The rest is white.
      The bloodstained section definitely looks sharp enough to cause this wound
      but... why would it be here, poorly buried? \n(China added to evidence list)"
