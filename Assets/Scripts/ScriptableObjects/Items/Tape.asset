    textResponse: "Looking more closely at the tape outline, it appears that the
      victim was laying fully on his stomach when the body was discovered. This combined
      with the fact that there are no scratches or bruises anywhere else on his body
      indicates that the victim was not facing his attacker when he died. I would
      say it's likely that he didn't even realize the attacker was there. \n(Tape
      added to evidence list)"
