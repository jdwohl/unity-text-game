    textResponse: Picking up the claw, it really sets in  just how big it is. I have
      trouble believing that this could belong to any animal known to man... Since
      the police hadn't seen it before I found it, I asked them to investigate it
      now. It is incredibly sharp -- it could have easily caused the type of wound
      seen in all of the victims. Whatever material it is, holding it up to the light
      doesn't illuminate anything about it. The light doesn't seem to reflect off
      of it at all either. What in the world...
