    textResponse: 'The eyewitness appears to have seen the attack take place in the
      center of the stadium. She believes that the attacker thought that the victim
      was the only other person in the stadium, as the witness is a member of the
      stadium staff that wasn''t supposed to be here yesterday. Her angle of viewing
      the scene combined with how far away she was meant that she didn''t see much
      detail, but she says she saw the attacker running at the victim, stabbing him
      with something from behind. She saw the weapon protrude from the victim''s
      chest, reflecting the light from the stadium, but she couldn''t tell what it
      was. '
