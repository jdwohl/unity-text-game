    textResponse: 'A sword with the hotel victim''s blood that is clearly sharp enough
      to cause the fatal wound. Could this case get any easier? ...Is what I''d like
      to say, but this sword is so obviously out-of-place that I have to assume it
      isn''t the real murder weapon. The blood could easily have been planted after
      the fact, of course. Though buying a real sword would be a lot of effort for
      the attacker to go through just to use it as a prop... While examining the
      sword, the officer tells me that this victim is a bit different from the others
      in that he has a non-fatal bruise on his head from contact with a flat object.
      Could that really have been from this sword?
