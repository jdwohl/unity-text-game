    textResponse: "Now that I'm looking at it up close, these crumbs are blue --
      that along with their texture indicate that they didn't come from something
      edible. In fact, they look more like... shards from something. There are only
      a few small ones at the scene, and they're only in this obscure position under
      the bed. Could the attacker have missed this when cleaning up? \n(Crumbs added
