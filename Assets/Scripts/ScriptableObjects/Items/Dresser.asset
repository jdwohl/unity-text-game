    textResponse: 'While a few dressers are missing all of their drawers, the one
      closest to the TV is only missing one. Looking at the closest drawer on the
      floor, it appears that there are only clothes inside. However, the other drawers
      in the dresser all contain folders and files. None of the drawers on the floor
      have anything other than clothes, and there are no drawers missing. Were there
      once files in that drawer? '
