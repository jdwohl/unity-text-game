    textResponse: "The knife is clean, but spraying luminol shows traces of the park
      victim's blood. Clearly there was some effort spent in hiding its relation
      to the crime, so why is it so close to the body? Something also seems off about
      this part here... Aha. Playing around with the intricacies of the weapon opened
      a secret compartment. Unfortunately, there's nothing inside. Only a bit of
      dirt. Actually, upon closer inspection it appears to be sand. ...There's no
      sand at this park. \n(Knife added to evidence list)"
