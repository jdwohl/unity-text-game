  description: I hadn't been to the train station in a while, and time certainly
    hasn't been kind to it. Once bustling with people, now it feels almost abandoned.
    No one is here besides the officer guarding the scene. It's not like this is
    only because of the crime either -- I've heard it's been like this for a while.
    What happened to this place... (To investigate something, type "examine" and
    its name)
