  description: I arrive at a beautiful lake, one of the central tourist attractions
    of this city. There's no one here besides the officer on guard now though --
    everyone else is being turned away at the entrance. It seems the scene of the
    crime was the sandy shore on the west side of the lake. (To investigate something,
    type "examine" and its name)
