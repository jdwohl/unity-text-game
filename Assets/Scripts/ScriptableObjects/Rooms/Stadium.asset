  description: This stadium is typically home to many sporting events. There was
    supposed to be one today, in fact -- the stadium's relevance to the cases have
    put that on hold. The crime scene appears to be the very middle of the stadium,
    with all of the outside lights pointing to the place where the victim was supposedly
    killed. It's a bit unsettling... (To investigate something, type "examine" and
    its name)
